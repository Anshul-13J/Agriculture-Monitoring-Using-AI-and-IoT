# Agriculture-Monitoring-Using-AI-and-IoT
This is an open-repo of our project for PowerToFly Hackathon

We are a team of 4 geeks: Mayur, Esha, Anshul and Tanu.
We have developed a simple solution -"AGROCARE" for all the farmers (and we got a HEALTHY apple for you at the end) !

Let's see the problem and their solutions:

PROBLEM 1-> Farmers don't know what exactly to grow to get the best yield in their fields.

OUR SOLUTION-> We have developed a user-friendly website AGROCARE that the farmer can use and go to the Crop section. There the farmer will get the option to set the field values of  the various parameters like Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Pottasium (found in soil), pH level of soil, rainfall in that area, and the location of that area.
As soon as the fermer hits enter, he'll get the perfect crop for his field based on the already trained model ruinning at the backend!
Sample is shown below:

Result:

IMPORTANT POINT: This might have struck in your mind that how will the farmer get to know about the readings? Well, we got you covered here as well!



"INTRODUCING THE PROTOTYPE OF SMART AGRICULTURE DEVICE"

Yes, this is just a prototype and device is not ready yet because of the time constraint of the hackathon, but it won't take much effort to make this device now, as it is majorly done.
This battery-operated device will be placed in the farm safely and will do all the monitoring by itself, like getting the data from sensors used and putting them on cloud so, they can be used by the ML model and farmer can get the results directly without any efforts!
This device will be connected to another master device, which will have the access to the internet to accomplish the task. This waas the IoT part!

Doesn't it looks interesting?? Then wait, we got MORE FOR YOU!!



PROBLEM 2-> Farmer has already planted a crop, but getting poor yield. What can he possible do to get a good yield?

OUR SOULTION-> Do some extra efforts and navigate to the Fertilizer section! There You'll again find the option to enter the N,P,K levels (Nitroge Phosphorus and Pottasium) as well as the crop the farmer has planted.
Now, based on the current state of your farm and the crop, again some back-end computation will take place and BOOM!
You're flooded with the improvement tips to improve your yield, BELIEVE ME, IT'S VERY FAST!

Again the smart IoT device can help a farmer to get the respective values and get the tips without any extra efforts, but for now, we'll have to provide manual input.

ISN'T AGROCARE EXCITING??  Wait, we got more!!



PROBLEM 3-> Crops get infected by the disease over time and maybe due to poor maintainance and that makes the yield poor and unhealthy. How are we going to tackle this issue?

OUR SOLUTION (yet again): Well, with a little extra efforts, navigate to the third tab - "Disease".
Here you'll find the option to upload an image, you just have to upload a simple image of leaf of your plant and that's it! With a single click, what you'll see is the name of your crop (predicted) and if there's and disease or not.
If any disease is found, you'll get a detailed explaination for the same. ISN'T IT AMAZING?? Let's see the practical working:

Looks like the apples are going to be healthy and yummy, what do you think?

Well, what are your views on this whole project? Do let us know where to improve and how to make it more usable!

THANK YOU!
